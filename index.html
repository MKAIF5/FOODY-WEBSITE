            <b> Indian Food :</b>consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to India. Given the
            diversity in soil,
            climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally
            available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Historical events such as invasions, &nbsp;&nbsp;trade
            relations, and
            colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the
            New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. A number of these such as potatoes,
            tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions of India.[3]

            Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe
            was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.[4] Spices were bought from India and traded around
            Europe and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially thosefrom Europe
            (especially Britain), the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America,
            Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.[5][6]

            <b> Pakistani cuisine</b> (Urdu: پاکستانی پکوان, romanized: pākistānī pakwān) can be characterised as a
            vibrant blend of regional cooking styles and flavours from across South, Central and Western Asia, as well
            as ingredients, recipes and techniques borrowed from the Indian Subcontinent, Persian cuisine and Arab
            cuisine. The cuisine of Pakistan also maintains certain Mughal influences within its recipes and
            techniques.[2][3] The country's various cuisines are varied from place to place, with its ethnic and
            cultural diversity, as well as diverse climates and geographical environments, and availability of different
            produce options.

            Pakistani cuisine, as in the food culture of most Muslim nations, is structured around halal principles
            (similar to Judaism and Kosher), which—for example—forbid pork and alcohol consumption in accordance with
            Sharia, the religious laws of Islam. Many more details of halal regulations apply to meats, which types of
            animals are acceptable or “clean” for human consumption—for example, pigs enjoy wallowing in mud, and are
            thus deemed “unclean”. Further important points declare precisely how animals are to be slaughtered; it must
            be done quickly and with minimal suffering, with the animal’s awareness of the situation being extremely
            brief (preferably nonexistent, as stress releases cortisol and adrenaline, potentially spoiling meat
            quality). The animals must also be raised (more or less) “free-range”, with sufficient freedom of movement
            provided, as halal principles forbid the consumption of sickly, stressed, abused, beaten, cancerous or
            otherwise mistreated or unhealthy animals. Additionally, animals that are killed inadvertently, or during
            accidents or found deceased by the roadside, are forbidden, as the intention was not slaughter in those
            cases.

        <p>
            <center>Restaurants know the importance of a strong first impression. It's why they invest in exterior
                design,
                decorate their entranceways and train hosts to welcome guests with a warm smile.

                Nowadays, however, more than 70% of diners visit a restaurant's website before deciding where to dine,
                which
                means the first impression happens long before they set foot on-premises. It happens online. And when it
                does, the restaurant description plays a pivotal role.</center>

        <p>
            <center>Despite this, many restaurants struggle to write an effective description for their website. Doing
                so
                requires a mix of skills not every restaurant has — writing, design and a keen understanding of digital
                user
                behavior — but there are tools in place to make the job easier. For example, if you build your website
                with
                BentoBox, full-service designers can help create your website on a template that is proven to be
                user-friendly. That takes care of the design and user behavior hurdles.

                To help overcome the writing hurdle, we've created the resource below. In addition to defining best
                practices, we have curated 20 examples of effective restaurant descriptions and analyzed why they work.
                If
                you don't know where to start or feel stuck, scroll through these examples and see if they spark new
                ideas.
